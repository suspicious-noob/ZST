## 📋 How to Use

### 🖱 Drag and Drop

1. Drag any file or folder onto `ZST.bat`
2. The script will auto-analyze and recommend compression settings
3. Choose whether to proceed, cancel, or archive without compression

### 📜 Manual Menu

Double-click `ZST.bat` to access the main menu:

- `[1]` Compress file or folder
- `[2]` List archive contents
- `[3]` Extract full archive
- `[4]` Extract a single file
- `[5]` Exit

During compression:

- System hardware is detected
- Optimal settings are recommended
- You can override method and thread count

Archive files are saved with a `.zpaq` extension.

## 🔐 Safety Notice

ZST uses system resources heavily for compression. Systems with low RAM or CPUs may experience slowdowns or crashes. The script includes:

- Clear warnings
- Safe default settings
- Overwrite confirmation prompts

Use at your own risk. The author assumes no responsibility for data loss or hardware issues.
